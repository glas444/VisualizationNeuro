# MOCAP PROJECT

## KTH Master's Degree Project in Computer Science 
### Specialisation in Visualisation and Interactive Graphics

## Unity 
Version: 2021.3.3f1

## Introduciton
Welcome to the VisualizationNeuro repository, developed as part of a Master's degree program in the field of crainal neurosurgery. This project focuses on the creation of an innovative and interactive visualization tool designed to enhance the understanding and planning of neurosurgical procedures. The animation was converted from pre-motion captured recordings of the procedure to unity model positions. 

## Key Features:

### 3D Visualization Animation:
The project features a neurosurgical proceedure called Extra Ventricular Drainage (EVD) which is visualised as a 3D animation. Included in the animation is a ventricle, cathether and skull model. The animation is projected in both a Virtual Reality environment and a Desktop environment.

### Temporal Controls
The user is able to control the animation through temporal controls. These include,
- Play/Pause
- Step Forward / Step Backward (1 Frame)
- Speed Forward / Speed Backwawrd (5 Frames)
- Wind Forward / Wind Backward (Hold)
- Slider

### Virtual Reality Environment
In the VR environemnt the user inteacted with the 3D animation through a HTC Vive Pro headset and its two VR controllers.
The VR HMD acted as the camera and the two controllers were assigneed with temporal and spatial respectively.

### Desktop Environment
In the Desktop Environment the user inteacted with the 3D animation through a desktop monitor, keyboard and mouse. 
The user was able to fly around the 3D scene using the keyboard and rotate the camera using the mouse.

### Spatial controls Desktop
- Rotate Camera (looks around the environment in first person view)
- ROtate Around Marker [ROAM] (rotates around the marker at the current distance from it)
- WASD keys for forward/back/left/right
- Q&E to go up and down


## Credits
This project is based on previous work made by Team Dream for the course Advanced Projects in Interactive Media Technology, HT2022, KTH. The group consisted of four KTH Students: Marcus Holmberg, Måns Nyman, Léa Prémont, Mahmoud Sherzad. Their original code can be found at: https://github.com/MarcusHolmbrg/TeamDreamMocapProject
